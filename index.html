            <p>Hi my name is Christopher Glenn. A brief history about me is I was first introduced to programming in College. I went to Missouri State for computer science, and I initially only applied for computer science because it had the word "computer" in its name. I grew up spending about an easy average of twelve hours a day on a computer. Anywhere from just playing world of warcraft to just skyping the friends I met across the world.</p>

        <p class="para">I spent two years there, ended up hating college but felt the opposite about programming. I decided to drop out I had no interest in school in general. So I moved back home and was able to get an amazing job at a lake bar in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. Where I spent alot of my time growing up there and maturing.</p>
        <p class="para">A few years past by and I was in a stage in my life where I have no idea what to do. So in a two week time span I packed my bags and moved to Miami for a ltitle less than a year. I went through a few entry level jobs, got to a live a city life, live in another culture, in a totally different world. It was absolutely the best experience of my life but it did teach me that I want to pursue a career and become someone of more importance. So I did alot thinking on what I should attempt to pursue and went back to the idea of programming. Which is how I ended up here in Kansas City, MO in this bootcamp.</p>
